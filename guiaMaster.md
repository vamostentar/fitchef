Role: Senior Full Stack Developer & UI/UX Architect Objective: Build the MVP for "FitChef.pro", a SaaS for Personal Trainers to generate AI meal plans and export them as branded PDFs. Tech Stack:

Frontend: React (Vite), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (using a modern, dark-mode first aesthetic like Shadcn/UI), Lucide React (icons).

Backend: Node.js (Express), TypeScript.

AI Integration: Placeholder for OpenAI API / Gemini API call.

PDF Generation: react-pdf or jspdf for client-side rendering.

1. DESIGN SYSTEM & UI GUIDELINES (The "High-Level" Look)
Theme: "Cyber-Fitness". Primary color is Emerald Green (#10b981) against a deep Slate/Zinc dark background (#09090b).

Typography: Inter or Geist Sans. Clean, legible, professional.

Components:

Use rounded corners (rounded-xl).

Use subtle borders (border-zinc-800).

Use glassmorphism effects for cards (bg-zinc-900/50 backdrop-blur-md).

Dashboard: Must look like a "Command Center" for the PT.

Input Form: A multi-step "Wizard" interface (Step 1: Client Bio, Step 2: Goals, Step 3: Preferences).

2. CORE FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT
A. The Layout (Frontend)
Create a responsive layout with a Sidebar (Navigation) and a Main Content Area.

Sidebar Items: Dashboard, New Client, My Plans, Settings.

Header: User Profile (Mock), Notifications.

B. The "Meal Plan Generator" (The Core Logic)
Create a complex form component MealPlanWizard.tsx that collects:

Client Metrics: Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Activity Level.

Goals: Fat Loss, Muscle Gain, Maintenance. (Include a slider for "Target Calories" that auto-calculates based on metrics using Harris-Benedict, but allows manual override).

Dietary Preferences: Dropdown (Omnivore, Vegetarian, Vegan, Paleo, Keto).

Allergies/Exclusions: Text input tags.

C. The Data Structure (Types)
Define a TypeScript interface MealPlan that the AI must return. It must be strict JSON:

TypeScript

interface MealPlan {
  clientName: string;
  targetCalories: number;
  macros: { protein: number; carbs: number; fat: number };
  weeklyPlan: {
    day: string; // e.g., "Monday"
    meals: {
      type: "Breakfast" | "Lunch" | "Dinner" | "Snack";
      name: string;
      calories: number;
      ingredients: string[]; // For the shopping list
      instructions: string;
    }[];
  }[];
  shoppingList: { category: string; items: string[] }[];
}
D. The Backend API (Node.js)
Create a mock controller generatePlan in the backend that simulates the AI response (since we don't have the API key live yet).

It should accept the form data.

It should return a valid JSON object matching the MealPlan interface above.

Note for AI: Write the actual System Prompt you would send to the LLM to generate this JSON perfectly.

E. The PDF Export (The Product)
Create a PDFRenderer component using react-pdf.

It must take the MealPlan data.

It must render a beautiful, printable A4 page.

Header: PT Logo (placeholder) + Client Name.

Body: A clean grid layout for the weekly meals.

Footer: "Generated by FitChef.pro".

3. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
Please provide the code in a modular file structure:

types.ts: The shared interfaces.

App.tsx: Main routing and layout.

components/MealWizard.tsx: The input form with Tailwind styling.

server/index.ts: The Node.js server setup with the generation endpoint.

utils/aiPrompt.ts: The precise prompt text to send to the LLM to get the structured JSON.

Start by setting up the project structure and the MealWizard component with the high-end UI requested.
